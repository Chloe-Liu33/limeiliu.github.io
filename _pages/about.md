Profile 
======

I am a final-year PhD Candidate(completed all 3 milestones) at Monash University specializing in Causal Inference and Multimodal Spatio-temporal AI. My research focuses on developing robust, generalizable Machine Learning models
for complex urban systems and biological data. I have published paper in IEEE T-ITS and served as a reviewer for Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies.
